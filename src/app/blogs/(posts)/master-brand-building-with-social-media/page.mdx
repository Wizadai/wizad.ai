## Fundamentals of brand building: Brand Identity and Consistency

### Brand Identity: 

Brand Identity refers to the features and aspects of your brand which make it unique and different, compared to other brands. A customer unintentionally uses the core principle of brand Identity to choose his/her desired brand's product from the many which offer it. For instance, You want to buy a bathing soap. You go to the supermarket to find brands like Pears, Santoor, Medimix, Lux, Dove, etc. How you're going to choose a particular brand is determined on two bases: (a) Brand loyalty which is the result of an effectively and consistently built brand Identity, in the long run. (b) Brand Identity. You recognise a particular brand from the rest of them, often through a certain visual perception (logo, font, text, theme, etc).

### Brand Consistency: 

Brand Consistency is what creates a purpose for a brand's identity. It suggests that the aspects associated with a particular brand should be consistent and fixed. Logo, font, text, style, mood, and other applications of a brand's personality should not change, so your customers can identify the key factors distinguishing your brand’s products from others’.

Let us now, answer the bigger question:

## How does Wizad help you in Brand Building by maintaining a consistent and distinct Brand identity?

[Wizad AI](https://wizad.ai/ "Wizad AI") is an affordable and resourceful application powered by Artificial Intelligence to create multiple poster designs for varied uses. It is advantageous to small-scale business and startup owners, who cannot afford to spend a hefty sum on social media management. To use the app, you’d have to set up a business profile, wherein you have to upload the details about your brand (like the name of the entity, logo, industry, phone number, e-mail, address, and About). Brand colours will be automatically updated from the uploaded logo. You can also choose a brand style from the given options. This is what contributes to the theme and personality of the designs you generate, which inevitably communicates your brand personality. Business owners can now create marketable posters for their brand’s social media, even with limited funds. They can post brand-specific content on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Whatsapp etc. to satisfy their target audience. However, designing posters and circulating them is not enough. With a valuable resource like Wizad, brand owners must ensure that they take care of these things while operating their social media platforms:
- Interact and engage with your audience daily. Respond to their comments & DMs and take note of their suggestions. Your viewers should feel as if they are a part of your brand and their feedback is important to the organisation.
- Be consistent in posting content on social media. Do not miss out on any occasion to showcase your business to the digital world. As mentioned you can design a wide variety of posters through our Wizad app, despite the occasion. Daily stories, Daily Facts, upcoming special days, Topic to Poster, Product Poster, etc are some of the many features available on the application! Utilise it to make content, even if you are not inspired to do something specific. Otherwise, make reels, video stories and collaboration content to grow your audience.
- Create meaningful relationships with the audience. Make them feel included in the process of building your brand. Eventually, it’s the viewers who transition to your loyal customers.

In conclusion, effective brand-building in the digital era revolves around creating a strong and authentic presence that resonates with customers. Social media serves as a platform for businesses to share their values, showcase their identity, and engage with their audience.
