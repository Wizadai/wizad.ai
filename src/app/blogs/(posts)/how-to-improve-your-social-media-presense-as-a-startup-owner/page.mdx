With over 4.7 billion people using social media globally, it offers unmatched reach and engagement opportunities, making it a powerful tool for building brand equity, increasing customer acquisition, and driving sales conversions. And yet, many startups still struggle to utilise this power effectively. The good news? You don’t need a massive marketing budget to build a strong social media presence. In fact, with the right strategies, you can grow your following and boost your sales without exhausting your funds.

Now, let us ask the real question- Why has your startup organisation not been able to establish a brand identity yet? Maybe, it is because you haven’t given much importance to your Social Media. Or perhaps you have; 

However, Wizad is here to guide you with-

## SIX hacks for startup owners to improve their social media presence:

### 1. Communicate your Brand identity through posts:

Make sure that each post and story revolves around your brand’s identity and personality. Whether it’s about the colour palettes, fonts, dimensions or images, etc, ensure that it aligns with your brand. This is just so that your audience and potential customers can recognise and differentiate your brand from the others. You can associate a certain colour, idea, etc with your brand. For example: The green owl is used as a tool for brand recognition by the language-learning application Duolingo. Suppose you’re walking through the supermarket aisles, you're in the toothpaste section and you see several brands of toothpaste. However, you chose to take ‘Colgate’ because you suddenly remembered the posters and advertisements as you saw the logo, font, colour palette, etc. This is one of the most common applications of brand recognition among consumers. As a startup owner or small-scale business owner, you have to work in such a way that your viewers can differentiate your products from those of your competitors. Your audience and viewers should get converted as your customers.

### 2. Posters on special days:

Special days are a huge opportunity for brand owners to showcase their products or services to their potential consumers. Never miss out on such special days even in your busy schedules, with Wizad, an AI-based poster generation tool beneficial to small-scale business owners. A startup owner should be consistent in nurturing a relationship with their customers. Greeting posters, special-day sale posters, Give-away posters, etc can be circulated through different social media platforms to gain viewership. [Click here for social-media content ideas for different special days](https://wizad.ai/social-media "Blogs related to social media by Wizad.ai").  Here, are a few special-day posters created using the Wizad app:

<div className="mx-auto flex w-full flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-2">
  <img
    src="/blog-assets/blog14/rose-day-poster.webp"
    alt="Rose Day Poster"
    className="my-0 md:w-2/5"
  />
  <img
    src="/blog-assets/blog14/republic-day-poster.webp"
    alt="Republic Day Poster"
    className="my-0 md:w-2/5"
  />
</div>

### 3. Regular feedback and interaction:

The admin of your social media handles should take special care to interact and communicate with your customers regularly. Clarifying doubts and taking suggestions from your audience through DMs is one such form of interaction. You should also respond to the comments on your posts on different online platforms. Make sure to log in to your account and check for any new updates, almost every day. Regular interaction and frequent communication with your customers will not only boost engagement but also make your followers stay. 

### 4. Fun games or activities:

Conduct occasional game sessions and other activities to engage your viewers. This hack can also be used when you have nothing else to post, but do not want to disrupt the engagement. A fun quizzing series, This or That, Q&A, etc are some of the few activities which you can rely on.

### 5. Well-designed product posters:

Post pictures and videos of your product or service. Make sure that it’s professional but also relatable to the audience. The Audience tends to skip through those pictures or videos which lack quality. If you are a business owner with limited funds, hiring professional photographers and designers to shoot and edit your product posters must be exhaustive. Instead, let Wizad AI do it for you! Capture a decent photo of the product and upload it on the app under the ‘product photography poster’ feature. Wait for a couple of seconds and see the wizardry for yourself as the mobile-captured photo is transformed into a professional one.

### 6. Posting Consistently:

Consistency is the key when it comes to whatever you do to market your brand, especially through social media. Do not get distracted by the number of likes, views or followers you get. Whether the number is small or huge, keep posting. To establish a unique digital presence, you have to engage with the viewers, learn what content they require and post consistently.  

Building a strong social media presence as a startup owner may seem challenging, but with the right strategies, it’s achievable. By focusing on consistent branding, creating engaging content, and having meaningful interactions with your audience, you can effectively place your organisation along with other huge brands in the digital landscape. AI Tools like Wizad simplify this process by helping you create eye-catching content and stay in touch with social media trends. Always remember that success on social media isn’t just about gaining followers—it’s about creating lasting relationships with your audience, driving engagement, and ultimately growing your business. Therefore, consider and follow these tips to build an efficient social media marketing strategy, and watch your startup thrive in the competitive digital world.
