Social media is a potent marketing tool that can **improve your sales**, through which you can establish a brand identity. Let us understand it by using an example ['Popflex by Blogilates'](https://www.popflexactive.com/), owned and run by Cassey Ho, who initially used to upload pilates tutorials and other blogs on her YouTube channel. In 2016, she launched a fashion brand as an answer to the problems faced by many of her viewers as well as herself. Popflex sells customer-friendly crop tops, jumpsuits, leggings, and many other original designs. She used social media to her utmost advantage, causing her creations to get widespread attention. She started posting content consistently on her Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and other social networking platforms. A business which started as a micro-scale clothing brand achieved a sales target of $15 Million last year (2023). It is evident that the ** involvement of social media** combined with her unique product strategy is what influenced the success of her business.

She was also able to capture the attention of her audience and set herself a space in this largely competitive industry through social media marketing.

Similarly, you can also bring about development and growth in your firm/ proprietorship by creating and curating content to elevate your marketing strategy. Here are some tips and tricks to effectively strategise your digital media visibility.

## The THREE Cs to Elevate Your Social Media Presence:

### TIP NO. **3- CONSISTENCY**

Consistency is the key to having a thriving social media account- **posting under a daily schedule** makes your audience aware of your existence as a business. You can stay consistent through various features like Posts, Reels, Stories, Live, DMs, Comments, ADs, etc. Sometimes, you may feel too exhausted to do something creative for your social media, even then it might be necessary to _post something to not lose your consistency_. One should also acknowledge that it will take sufficient time to gain views and followers on a digital media platform. No one should give up on social media just because it takes time to establish your brand on social media. In this blog, we will also get to know how to create social media content in a short time.

### TIP NO. **2- COMMUNICATION**

Regular communication and interaction with your audience create more engagement in your profile. This will help you gain viewership and more people will get to know your brand! One should make sure to respond to Direct Messages and Comments and make your viewers feel included in your venture. You should also take suggestions and feedback from your audience seriously so they feel connected to your brand for the long term.

### TIP NO. **1- CONTENT CREATION**

It is crucial to plan your content creation strategy before executing it. It usually depends upon many factors like, What type of products you sell, who your target customers are, etc. Conducting a study on the online media consumption pattern of your target customers can help you understand how to plan an effective content strategy.

#### **What type of content can you post online?**

Social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or TikTok allow you to post photos, videos or write-ups through features like Posts, Stories/ Status, Reels, etc. A business can utilise these features to _present its area of business creatively_.

Here are a few examples of some content ideas for businesses:

- Product/service Give-away Reel (with conditions)
- Introducing a new product/service to your audience
- Product/service reviews from customers
- Hacks and tips for using your product
- _Special days post/ story_

**NOTE:** A brand owner must _never miss out on special days_ like Christmas, Holi, Independence Day, etc. These special days provide an opportunity to advertise your content under the tag of a special occasion. It helps the brands to establish a space in the vision of their potential customers.

#### AI Tools to help increase efficiency in posting:

If there are TWO things that almost all business owners face, it would be **Lack of Funds** AND **Scarcity of time.** We’ve all been told that without these two resources, it might seem impossible to create content consistently.

However, not anymore. Yes, You did hear that right!!
