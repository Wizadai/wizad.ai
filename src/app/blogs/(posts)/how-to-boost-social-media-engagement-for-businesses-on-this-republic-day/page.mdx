If you post customer-specific content curated for the upcoming Republic Day of India, you can also grow your audience just like your competitors! **Here, are some ideas and examples to boost your social media presence during special days like Republic Day:**

Type in a certain topic i.e., ‘Republic day of India’ and click ‘create’. You will get information/fact posters related to the Republic Day of India, just like these:

    alt="Awards and Honors on Republic Day Poster"
    className="my-0 md:w-2/5"
  />
</div>

## 3. Special Day Give Away posters

Hold special events like lucky draws and giveaways on the occasion of Republic Day and circulate it through your social media. Not only will this attract more viewers to your page, but also the cost of the product you plan to giveaway is covered by the promotion your business receives.

If you own a small-scale business in the food/beverage sector, you might as well be open to a lucky-draw where the winner gets a free drink of their choice. Head onto Wizad, and you’ll see a space that says, ‘enter a couple of keywords here’. Write some prompt, for example, “Republic Day Special Give Away on Drink” and click “Generate”.

## 4. Vibrant and thematic pictures of your product

Upload photographs of your products in a way that aligns with the occasion, i.e., Republic Day, as well as your brand identity. The pictures should be of high quality and should communicate with your audience effectively.

This will also cause an urgency among your potential customers to buy the particular product/service as soon as possible so that they don't miss out on these price reductions.
