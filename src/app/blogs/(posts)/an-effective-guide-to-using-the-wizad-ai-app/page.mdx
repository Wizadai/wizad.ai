[Wizad AI](https://wizad.ai) is a feasible answer to this question. Poster-making is an integral part of social media marketing and content creation that most businessmen fail to acknowledge. Are you tired of browsing through poster templates to create professional designs? Well, not anymore because now, Wizad AI is here to make your job ten times easier. Wizad is a mobile application which uses Generative AI to create content that you can post on your social media handles. It creates posters and designs without compromising on your brand’s identity and aesthetics.

**This blog will guide you on how to use the app with minimum effort and maximum results. Follow these guidelines to get started:**

- You can download the app from [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.wizad.wizad) or [Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/wizad-ai-poster-maker/id6458984305)
- Initially, you have to _create an account._
- Then, you can set up your business profile. You need to set them only once and it will help you create industry-specific content, appropriate for your business. This is how you can set it up:

  1. Upload your _brand’s logo_ and remove the background.
  2. Enter your _business entity’s name._
  3. Give a brief _about/ introduction_ to your business.
  4. Select your _Industry_ from the given options. If your line of work is not available on the list, click ‘other’ and type your industry name.
  5. Give the _necessary contact details_ which you want to display in the posters/ stories.
  6. Select a _brand style_. The brand style you choose will dictate the style of your poster- The font, imagery and tone of voice of the text will vary according to the chosen Brand Style. For eg: If you opt for ‘Mercedes’, You’ll get _luxurious_ and _classic designs_ AND If you opt for ‘McDonald's’, you’ll get _fun_ and _welcoming_ designs! Similarly, you can select a style which encapsulates the identity and theme of your brand. You can change these anytime to match the aesthetics of specific posters.
  7. The colour palette used in the posters will be automatically extracted from the brand logo. However, you can customize them from the _‘Brand Colour’_ option.
  8. Click _‘done’_ and now you have an updated _business profile_!

  **Here are some illustrations of a few profiles from various industries:**
