With the rise of new industries and businesses, small-scale business owners now have to compete with big brands in their industry. For example, the evolution of top-notch cosmetic brands like Maybelline or Dior has led to people opting for their products instead of their many other competitors’ products. This has everything to do with how well they advertise and market their products. Let’s say, every other business in the fashion sector wants to build a promotion strategy as effective as Zara, Calvin Klein, or any other big brands. Every food industry businesses want to market their products like how KFC or Pizza Hut does. The question is how?

Social media marketing has come a long way throughout this decade. Did you know that more than 43% of consumers find products through social media? The involvement of technology in the marketing field has brought about a significant rise in using generative AI to create marketable content, which is extremely cost-effective and cheaper than traditional marketing strategies. Through this Artificial Intelligence technology, you can design and promote posters & adverts which serve as a medium to capture the attention of your potential customers.

## Wizad AI as an effective tool in social media marketing

Used by more than ten thousand business owners, Wizad AI is a handy application for creating and generating advertisable posters. Unique designs are curated at your ease, using AI. You can share these posters online through your social media handles and thereby reach a wider audience. The services offered by Wizad are a budget-friendly marketing investment.

Here are some of the many reasons why you should also check the Wizad app out if you're a brand owner:

- **No Need To Outsource Designers-** You need not waste your valuable time & money trying to find a designer who can create content for you to post. Wizad gives you the same or even better quality designs at a faster pace and lower price. You can utilise these resources to improve many other areas of your business, making no room for opportunity costs.

- **Pocket Friendly-** It is less expensive as compared to other alternatives. Especially for small-scale business owners, who can't afford to spend a huge amount on marketing their products or services, Wizad is just the right choice.

- **Aesthetics-** You need not compromise on the aesthetics of your brand. Wizad helps you create appealing and distinctive designs that can capture the attention of your probable customers.

- **Brand Identity-** You can create designs while keeping your brand identity intact. A brand’s identity is heavily dependent on the font or typography, logo colour palette and other imageries used in their design.

Wizad helps you do just that!
