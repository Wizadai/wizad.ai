We acknowledge your struggle with using Canva to create designs, and we are here to help you solve this problem!! Sure, Canva can be a lifesaver when it comes to making Resumes, Collages, or other visual documents. But, as you and I have experienced,

> **Making customised poster or story content for your
business without compromising on your brand identity,
can be a tough job with Canva.**

Not having enough time and money to spend on professional softwares or designers is a problem faced by almost all micro-to-small scale business owners and solopreneurs. However, with the rise of advanced technologies like Generative AI, there are many tools which let you create these marketable designs within seconds. Wizad AI is one of the best among them. Here is a comparison study to see if you should switch to Wizad for better results

## Disadvantages of Using Canva to Create Posters for Your Business:
- **WASTING TIME TRYING TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE TEMPLATE:** The layout and template of a design play a significant role in attracting the attention of your potential customers. It is an absolute struggle to sit and scroll through templates.
- **LIMITED CUSTOMIZATION AND EDITING OPTIONS:** Even if you get a good template, you might have to do major editing to complement your brand identity.
- **OVERUSE OF TEMPLATES:** The same templates are used repeatedly, taking out the uniqueness in your designs.
- **HARD TO MAINTAIN BRAND CONSISTENCY:** Brand consistency ensures the development of goodwill and reputation of your brand. As there is little to no control over Canva’s features, it might seem challenging to present your brand to your audience.
- **LACKS ORIGINALITY:** The designs are generic and similar to each other. Since a single template is used multiple times, it tends to become monotonous and lacks freshness and originality.
- **COMPLICATED TO USE:** The interface is not always user-friendly and most features can be easy to use for professional designers only.
- **PERFORMANCE ISSUES:** Many users have been reported to face performance issues and lagging while running the app, especially when used on mobile phones.
- **TIME CONSUMING:** It takes a lot of time and effort to create designs on canva. The result might not always be worth the sweat and blood.
