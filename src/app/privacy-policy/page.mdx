## What does this policy cover

Welcome to Wizad, the online and mobile service of Wizard Flair PVT LTD("Wizad," "we," or "us"). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information. If you do not want your information processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our online or mobile services.

## 1. Information we collect and its use

We collect the following types of information about you:

**(a) Information you provide us directly**

We may ask for certain information when you register for a Wizad account or correspond with us (such as a username, your first and last names, birthdate, phone number, profession and e-mail address, business details).

**(b) Information we receive from third parties**

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or services through a third-party connection or log in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by "following," "liking," adding the Wizad application, linking your account to the Wizad Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Wizad. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Wizad Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will no longer receive information collected about you in connection with that service. We may also receive information about you and your engagement with our advertisements from our ad servers, ad networks and social media platforms. And if you choose to integrate with a third party application to incorporate elements into your designs, enhance media, supercharge your workflow or share to social media, we could receive data from such apps (as well as disclose to such apps as set out below).

**(c) Information we collect from you automatically**

We will directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information (in respect of which, please see the paragraph on log file information below) that assists us in improving the Service.

**(d) Log file information**

Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**(e) Clear gifs/web beacons information**

When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

**(f) Device identifiers**

When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers," such as a universally unique identifier ("UUID"). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Wizad. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. Device Identifiers used by Wizad include the Android Advertising ID and iOS Advertising Identifier.

**(h) Location data**

Wizad collects information in order to understand where its users are located for a number of reasons. It helps Wizad to localise and personalise content, undertake aggregated analytics, understand if its users are from homes, businesses or schools, improve advertising efficiency and estimate the tax liability of Wizad.

Wizad may collect your precise or approximate location:

- from you, when you provide, correct or confirm your location (e.g. when you purchase products from us);
- by inferring your location from your IP address; and
- from our partners or your payment provider.

## 2. How we use your information

We use the information we collect about you for the purposes set out above which we have described in more detail below:

- **Providing you with the Service**: We use the information that you provide us to provide the Service to you. This includes allowing you to log in to Wizad, operating and maintaining the Service, giving you access to your designs and billing you for transactions that you make via the Service. We also use information we collect about you automatically to remember information about you so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site.
- **For data analytics**: We use information about you to help us improve the Wizad Service and our users' experience, including by monitoring aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns.
- **For data labelling and machine learning to improve our services**: We use content and media in user's private accounts (such as photos, videos and audio) to train our models to apply machine learning to new unseen media and improve our service for users. This could include: components (ie background, eyes); labelling raw individual data (ie "man with dog"); detecting content prohibited by our terms of use for moderation and security purposes (i.e. pornographic or copyright protected material); translating audio soundtracks. This improves our service to users by for example, allowing our photo editing tools to rectify red eye and blemishes, recolour or erase components and remove backgrounds from photos and video.
- **Customising the Service for you**: We use information you provide us and information about you to make sure that your use of the Service is customised to your needs. For example, if you tell us your profession to recommend designs that are likely to be relevant to you.
- **To communicate with you about the Service**: We use your contact information to get in touch with you and to send communications about critical elements of the Service. For example, we may send you emails about technical issues, security alerts or administrative matters.
- **To promote and drive engagement with the Wizad Service**: We use your contact information to get in touch with you about features and offers relating to the Service that we think you would be interested in. We also use information we collect about you to make sure that you get the most relevant offers and promotions based on your use of the Service, and your preferences. You can opt-out of getting these communications as described below.
- **For advertising purposes**: We use information about you, including cookies information and other information we (and our third-party partners) collect from you automatically, to serve and measure the effectiveness of advertising on the Service and third-party sites and platforms.
- **Customer happiness**: We use information about you, information that you provide to our customer happiness team, and information about your interactions with the Service to resolve technical issues you experience with the Service, and to ensure that we can repair and improve the Service for all Wizad users.
- **For security measures**: We use information about you to monitor activity that we think is suspicious or potentially fraudulent, and to identify violations of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.
- **For matters that you have specifically consent to**: From time to time Wizad may seek your consent to use your information for a particular purpose. Where you consent to our doing so, we will use it for that purpose. Where you no longer want us to use your information for that purpose you may withdraw your consent to this use.
- **For matters that we are required to use your information by law**: Wizad will use or disclose your information where we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Wizad, our Users or others.

## 3. Sharing your information

**(a) Who we share your information with**

We share your information with third-party service providers for the purpose of providing the Service to you that is useful and safe and to facilitate Wizad's legitimate interests. Those service providers will only be provided with access to your information as is reasonably necessary for the purpose that Wizad has engaged the service provider, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy, appropriate data processing terms and any applicable laws.

Some of the third parties that Wizad may share your personal information with include providers who assist Wizad with functions such as:

- Billing;
- Customer support and customer management;
- Email services;
- Hosting and storage;
- Analytics;
- Data labelling and machine learning;
- Security;
- Advertising and marketing services;
- Delivery of physical products; and
- Other service providers.

**(b) Who you can choose to share your User Content with**

Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as public User Content (including Community Content as defined below), becomes available to be read, collected and used by the public. When you set your profile to public, join our Community or make User Content public, your information becomes publicly available globally, searchable by other Users and can be indexed by search engines. If you or Wizad remove information that you posted to the Service, copies remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. In the Community, your posts and other information will remain accessible (but with your profile information removed where possible – this may have been indexed by search engines or copied by other Users or included in the body of posts) to ensure the continued functioning of the Community.

You may share your Wizad designs to your social media accounts, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr. You should ensure that you familiarise yourself with the privacy policies of each of these services and any privacy settings that may apply to the designs you choose to share on those accounts.

If you join a Team, then any information or content that you create in that Team or activity you take within the Team may be shared with other Team members and the Team Owner. If requested by the Team Owner, Wizad may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the Team to the Team Owner or to another Team member. You should ensure that any personal information or confidential information that you'd like to maintain ownership over is retained in a separate account.

If you accept an invitation to view or edit a Wizad design:

- your name and avatar will be visible to anyone else in the design at the same time as you, whether or not they are logged in to Wizad or anonymous;
- your name and time of login will become available to any other person that also has edit access to that design, whether or not they are within your Team.

**(c) Sharing with other third parties**

Wizad will also share your information with third parties in certain circumstances, such as where:

- we are required to do so as a result of a court order, subpoena or other legal requirement;
- we believe that it is necessary to protect you or Wizad or other people from harm, such as where we consider that there is a need to investigate or warn of potentially fraudulent, malicious or criminal activity or remove malicious content. For example, this may involve sharing details of an account or website engaged in phishing or a breach of our Terms of Use with take down services, intelligence sharing services, law enforcement bodies or on public websites;
- you have consented to our sharing it with a third party for a particular purpose;

Wizad will also share your information with a third party in circumstances where we sell, divest or transfer Wizad (including any shares in Wizad), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses to a third party. Information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We will also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the event of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganisations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of Wizad. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Service if such a transaction takes place and be given notice of any material changes to the way we handle your data under this policy.

We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.

## 4. How we transfer, store and protect your data

Your information collected through the Service will be stored and processed in India and any other country in which Wizad or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Wizad transfers information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, and to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. As a result, we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. However, we always take steps to ensure that your information remains protected wherever it is stored and processed in accordance with applicable laws. Where required under applicable laws, you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Wizad or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

## 5. Keeping your information safe

Wizad cares about the security of your information, and uses appropriate safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Wizad, at all times. However, Wizad cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Wizad or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Wizad Service, such as social networks. Wizad is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

## 6. Compromise of information

In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Wizad will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

## 7. Your choices about your information

**(a) You control your account information and settings**

You may update your account information by logging into your account and changing your profile settings. You can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the "unsubscribe link" provided in such communications. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests.

You may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices) although you can object to us providing these emails by emailing hello@wizad.co

If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at hello@wizad.co

**(b) Opting out of collection of your information**

Please refer to your mobile device or browser's technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile device. Note that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents Wizad or its business partners from tracking your browser's activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted advertising activities by Wizad, including via third parties' websites. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, please contact us directly at hello@wizad.co.

**(c) Rights in respect of your Information**

The laws of some countries grant particular rights in respect of personal information. In certain circumstances, users in the EEA have the right to:

- Request a copy of your information;
- Request that we correct inaccuracies relating to your information;
- Request that your information be deleted or that we restrict access to it;
- Request a structured electronic version of your information; and
- Object to our use of your information.

Should you wish to make a request in respect of your personal information please contact us at hello@wizad.co You also have the right to object to our processing of personal data about you in order to send you marketing and we will stop processing data for that purpose.

**Account Deletion Request**: For existing customers who wish to permanently delete their account and all associated data, you may [submit a deletion request here](/account-deletion).

In some circumstances Wizad will not be able to comply with a request that you make in respect of your personal data. If we are unable to remove any of your information, we will let you know why. For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your information where it infringes on the rights of another User. For our Community, we will remove your profile information where possible, but this may have been indexed by search engines or copied by other Users or included in the body of posts. We may also be required to retain certain information that you ask us to delete for various reasons, such as where there is a legal requirement to do so. In some cases, you may have shared your information with third parties, such as by publishing a design on a third party's website. In that case Wizad will not be able to delete the information, and you will need to contact that third party directly.

If we are unable to resolve your request, or if you are concerned about a potential violation, you also have the option to report the issue or make a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction. Where you have provided your consent to certain processing and no longer want us to use your information for that purpose, you may withdraw your consent to this use, although this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Please see paragraph _"You control your account information and settings"_ for more options on how to opt-out of marketing communications.

## 8. How long we keep your information

Following termination or deactivation of your User account, Wizad will retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time, and for as long as we have a valid purpose to do so. In particular, Wizad will retain your information for the purpose of complying with its legal and audit obligations, and for backup and archival purposes.

## 9. Links to other websites and services

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party's own rules and policies. In addition, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for and we do not exercise control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook) and you allow such a third-party access to your User Content you do so at your own risk. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service.

## 10. Changes to this Policy

We may update this policy from time to time to reflect our current practice and ensure compliance with applicable laws. When we post changes to this policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
